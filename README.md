# Sentiment Analysis with SVM

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates sentiment analysis on tweets using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing technique that allows us to determine the sentiment or opinion of a given text. This technique is useful for extracting insights from social media, customer feedback, product reviews, and more.
